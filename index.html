corgis are small dogs that have lots of fur. They can be seen in cities such as New York, Chicago, Minnesota, Baltimore, and Connecticut. They have normal reflexes like regular dogs do. As puppies, corgis tend to walk on their small legs with practice. Over time, corgis become big dogs or they may stay little.They like to play with frisbees and jump up to catch their treats from doing tricks. Corgis are a lot of work as puppies, but once they get bigger they tend to go their own way with their owner still taking care of them up until adulthood.
